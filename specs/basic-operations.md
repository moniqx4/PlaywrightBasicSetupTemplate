# TodoMVC Application - Basic Operations Test Plan

## Application Overview

The TodoMVC application is a React-based todo list manager that demonstrates standard todo application functionality. The application provides comprehensive task management capabilities with a clean, intuitive interface. Key features include:

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, complete, and delete individual todos
- **Bulk Operations**: Mark all todos as complete/incomplete and clear all completed todos  
- **Filtering System**: View todos by All, Active, or Completed status with URL routing support
- **Real-time Counter**: Display of active (incomplete) todo count
- **Interactive UI**: Hover states, edit-in-place functionality, and responsive design
- **State Persistence**: Maintains state during session navigation
